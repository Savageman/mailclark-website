            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px"> MailClark was the postman of Slack and MS Teams from 2016 to 2022, whose mission was to help teams manage external and internal communications in one place.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px">Since MailClark joined Sendinblue in 2020, we concentrated our efforts on <a href="https://sendinblue.com/conversations/" class="is-underlined">bringing the best conversational experience to Sendinblue users</a>. In doing so, we were no longer as involved in the Slack and MS Teams ecosystems as we once were. We anticipated the time when we would not be able to maintain the service satisfactorily and shut down MailClark on December 31st, 2022.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px">Building MailClark has been an extraordinary journey, which we are proud of. Proud and grateful to our clients, partners and team who believed in our mission and supported us along the way.</p>
            <p>Anthony, Antoine, Gilles &amp; Julian</p>
